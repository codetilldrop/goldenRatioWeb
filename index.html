    <h2>What is the Golden Ratio?</h2>
    <p class = 'text'>The Golden ratio is a unique, irrational number found by dividing a line into two parts at a specific point, so that the longer part of the line divided by the shorter part is equal to the whole length of the line divided by the longer part of the line. The Golden Ratio is famous for making itself present in designs and artworks such as the Parthenon in Greece, The Mona Lisa painting and the Pyramids of Giza. The Golden Ratio, being an irrational number is often approximated to 1.618 however further approximations can be made such as approximating it to 1.6. The Golden Ratio can be represented as the symbol ùõó which stands for the Greek letter Phi.</p>
    <h2>What is the Formula?</h2>
    <p class = 'text'>(a + b) √∑ a = a √∑ b = ùõó</p>
